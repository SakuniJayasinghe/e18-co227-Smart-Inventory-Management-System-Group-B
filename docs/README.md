## Introduction

#### About

Scheduling and maintaining assets are important in an engineering laboratory, of for that matter any laboratory. Keeping track of the usage of all the tools manually is not easy, nor efficient. Hence, we now see that there are many automated systems used in labs to assist activties. 

#### Problem

The most commonly used methods such as file systems, etc are hard to maintain and are often not continued. Therefore, in a lab, you loose track of the items available, and as a result they will not be maintained properly. 
Traditional laboratories also do not allow for resource scheduling. There are times when students come to the lab with the hope of using a particular machine or tool and find that it is being used by another person. This could happen to you everytime you go to the lab intending to use that instrument. It is never vacant.
Thus, we see that traditional laborities have no proper scheduling methods, that lead to the waste of time and resources.

##### Solution

In response to the problems identified, we introduce a smart inventory management system with resource scheduling and maintenance scheduling. This system maintains an inventory of all tools in the lab and allows students/ lecturers to view and make reservations online for a particular item.
Additionally, the system is designed to sen scheduled reminders to the technical officers in charge of the lab about maintanance tasks to be carried out.
